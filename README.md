# Uptube

**Uptube** is an AI tool that helps YouTube creators share their videos with people all over the world by removing language barriers. It automatically translates not only the video’s audio but also the title, tags, description, and even the text on thumbnails.

✨ The result: viewers can watch and understand videos in their own language.

Uptube uses smart technology to remove background music, recognize speech, translate it, and then create natural-sounding voiceovers that match the original timing. Everything is synced perfectly, so the viewer experience feels smooth and natural.

With support for **10+ languages** (and more on the way), Uptube helps creators grow their audience, increase views, and reach new markets. It has already helped over **1000 users grow globally**—with some reporting **40% more views**.

Whether you're a **creator, educator, or business**, Uptube makes it easy to connect with the world through video.
